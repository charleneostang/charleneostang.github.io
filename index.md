I am a scientist, generalist and tea enthusiast. 

I lead Business Development at [Cyted](https://cyted.ai), a provider of digital diagnostics infrastructure to revolutionise the early detection of cancer.

When I'm not working, I am likely reading on one of my side projects, reading about something new, or exploring on foot. Wherever I am, a cup of tea is not far.

For more information on my [Projects](projects.md) and [Interests](interests.md), you can also [view my CV.](CV_Charlene_Tang_2021-01.pdf)

I graduated from Trinity College, University of Cambridge with a First-in-Class Masters in Natural Sciences, where I specialised in Biochemistry. 

I have gathered over 15 months of academic research experience, from tumour immunology and virology, to bioinformatics and synthetic biology. Over the past 2 years, I have expanded my business skill set across the innovation ecosystem. 

I am driven by increasing access to scientific understanding, technological advances, and opportunities for self development.
