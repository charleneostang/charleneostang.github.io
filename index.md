# Charlene Tang
## About

I am a scientist, generalist and tea enthusiast. I graduated from Trinity College, University of Cambridge with a First-in-Class Masters in Natural Sciences specialising in Biochemistry. I am currently leading business development at [Cyted](cyted.ai), a provider of digital diagnostics infrastructure to revolutionise the early detection of cancer.

When I'm not working, I am reading, walking or creating - with my piano, paint or food. Wherever I am, a cup of tea is not far.

## Projects & Interests
I think of my work in terms of themes and drivers. For a summary, you can [view my CV.](CV_Charlene_Tang_2020-12.pdf)
