As Head of Growth at Cyted, I lead our business development and commercial activities focused on the UK, where we are bringing a [new diagnostic test for cancer](https://cyted.ai/cytosponge) to patients. Since 2020, we have tested over 18,000 patients across the NHS. Here, I have won Â£4 million in non-dilutive funding to drive adoption & implementation (see [here](https://sbrihealthcare.co.uk/company/cyted/)), and have been awarded an [NHS Innovation Accelerator Fellowship](https://nhsaccelerator.com). 

When I'm not working on my day-job or one of my side-projects, I'm on a run, making pottery, or travelling with my sister & partner. For more information on my [Projects](projects.md) and [Interests](interests.md), you can also [view my CV.](Charlene Tang - CV - 2024-01.pdf)

I graduated from Trinity College, University of Cambridge with a First-in-Class Masters in Natural Sciences, where I specialised in Biochemistry. I have over 15 months of academic research experience, from tumour immunology and virology, to bioinformatics and synthetic biology. Over the past 3 years, I have expanded my commercial skill set across the biotech & medtech innovation ecosystem. 

Having lost my parents to cancer and heart failure by 11 and 22, I am driven by resolving needs faced by healthcare systems to save lives like theirs. I thrive in high-intensity environments with a continual demand to learn, adapt, and deliver. My purpose is to facilitate access to scientific understanding & clinical innovations, as well as opportunities for self awareness & development.
