I lead Business Development at Cyted, where we are bringing a [new diagnostic test for cancer](https://cyted.ai/cytosponge) to patients. Since 2020, we have tested over 12,000 patients across the NHS. Here, I have won Â£4.5 million in grant funding to drive adoption & implementation (see [here](https://sbrihealthcare.co.uk/company/cyted/), and have been awarded an [NHS Innovation Accelerator Fellowship](https://nhsaccelerator.com). 

When I'm not working, I am training for a half-marathon, crafting on a pottery wheel, or pursuing one of my side ventures (currently interested in synthetic molecules for immunooncology therapeutics). For more information on my [Projects](projects.md) and [Interests](interests.md), you can also [view my CV.](CV_Charlene_Tang_2022-10.pdf)

I graduated from Trinity College, University of Cambridge with a First-in-Class Masters in Natural Sciences, where I specialised in Biochemistry. I have over 15 months of academic research experience, from tumour immunology and virology, to bioinformatics and synthetic biology. Over the past 3 years, I have expanded my commercial skill set across the biotech & medtech innovation ecosystem. 

Having lost my parents to cancer and heart failure by 22, I am driven by resolving needs faced by healthcare systems to save lives like theirs. I thrive in high-intensity environments with a continual demand to learn, adapt, and deliver. My purpose is to facilitate access to scientific understanding & clinical innovations, as well as opportunities for self awareness & development.
