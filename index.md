# About

I am a scientist, generalist and tea enthusiast. 

I lead Business Development at [Cyted](cyted.ai), a provider of digital diagnostics infrastructure to revolutionise the early detection of cancer.

When I'm not working, I am reading, walking or creating - with my piano, paint or food. Wherever I am, a cup of tea is not far.

## Projects & Interests

I think of my work in terms of [projects](projects.md) and [interests](interests.md). For a summary, you can [view my CV.](CV_Charlene_Tang_2020-12.pdf)

I graduated from Trinity College, University of Cambridge with a First-in-Class Masters in Natural Sciences, where I specialised in Biochemistry. 

I have gathered over 15 months of academic [research](projects.md) experience from tumour immunology and virology, to bioinformatics and synthetic biology. Over the past 2 years, I have expanded my business skill set across the innovation ecosystem. 

My choices are driven by my [core values](interests.md) in increasing access to scientific understanding, technological advances, and your potential.
