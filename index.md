## About

Hello World. I am a generalist, biochemist, and tea enthusiast. I graduated First-in-class from my Masters in Natural Sciences from Trinity College, University of Cambridge. I am currently leading business development at [Cyted](cyted.ai), a provider of digital diagnostics infrastructure to revolutionise the early detection of cancer. For a summary, you can view [my CV.](CV_Charlene_Tang_2020-12.pdf)

I am integrating over 15 months research experience in academic labs and biomedtech start-ups, from tumour immunology to synthetic XNA biology. Through challenging yet inspiring successes at Jane Street: Women in Trading & Technology and the Cambridge Judge Business School, I realised that I thrive in high-intensity environments with a continual demand to learn, adapt, and deliver. I have since continued to develop my skill-set through strategy consulting with IQVIA, marketing and recruitment with Wiser, and due diligence for seed investment into early stage healthcare companies with the Start Codon Accelerator. 

Altogether, this complements my core strengths and drivers from leading over 4 societies to promote scientific understanding, mentoring younger students to access opportunities, and overcoming life challenges for kaizen: from family health emergencies to living in 5 countries across 3 continents (HK, Singapore, Korea, Brazil, UK).

## Projects
I think of my work in terms of themes and drivers.
