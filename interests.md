# Kaizen
I am driven by overcoming life challenges. I have navigated cultural dynamics and survived family health emergencies by making these barriers my fuel. 

I am mixed (half Chinese, half Irish) and grew up in 5 countries across 3 continents (HK, Singapore, Korea, Brazil, UK). This enables me to bridge the gap betweeen conflicting cultures and approaches. 

My mother was diagnosed with late-stage cervical cancer in 2009 and passed away a year later. Following the confusion surrounding her diagnosis and treatment options, I dedicated my learnings and research to understanding scientfic principles and furthering technological advances.

In 2017 and 2019, my father suffered from a series of strokes and now lives with heart failure. This fuelled my time at Heartfelt Technologies, a MedTech developing an in-home monitoring device to predict heart failure hospitalisation, where I evaluated their technology by talking to the team, patients and their carers.

# Access potential personal growth and development 

From these challenges and learning curves, I am determined to support others in their own journey towards awareness, resilience and purpose. Over the past 4 years, I have mentored my peers through life transitions: University, summer internships, PhD research, and now, alternate routes across the innnovation ecosystem. 
 
# Communicate understanding
Over the past 5 years, I have founded, supported and led over 5 student societies.

As Co-President of the Cambridge University Scientific Society, I have organised and chaired 15 lectures by leading academic researchers. I have launched, coordinated, chaired and presented at our annual Academic & Industrial Internships Event for Undergraduates on scientific research and alternative directions, from biotech venture building to early-stage investment.
