# Research projects
My aim is to integrate over 15 months research experience in academic labs and biomedtech start-ups, from tumour immunology to synthetic XNA biology. 

# Business projects
Through challenging yet inspiring successes at Jane Street: Women in Trading & Technology and the Cambridge Judge Business School, I realised that I thrive in high-intensity environments with a continual demand to learn, adapt, and deliver. I have since continued to develop my skill-set through strategy consulting with IQVIA, marketing and recruitment with Wiser, and due diligence for seed investment into early stage healthcare companies with the Start Codon Accelerator.
