# Business projects
Over the past 2 years, I have expanded my skill set across the innovation ecosystem:

* Due diligence for seed investment into early stage healthcare companies with the Start Codon Accelerator
* Gap Summit 2020 - an international, 10 month, virtual pitch competition and conference with the Global Biotech Revolution
* 48h-pitch competitions at the Cambridge Judge Business School
* Consulting on a market entry strategy for a gene therapy with IQVIA
* Corporate marketing and recruitment with Wiser 
* Data analysis and product experience evaluation with Heartfelt Technologies
* Jane Street: Women in Trading & Technology

Through these challenging yet inspiring successes, I realised that I thrive in high-intensity environments with a continual demand to learn, adapt, and deliver.
