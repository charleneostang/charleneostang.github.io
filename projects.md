# Business Development Experience

I lead Business Development at [Cyted](https://cyted.ai). Here, I am responsible for our commercial growth & strategy across the UK, which focuses on partnerships with the NHS and other organizations.

From my previous projects and roles in the company, I also work on:
* clinical service design and improvement,
* real word data and analytics,
* product marketing & communications,
* and global market access strategy.

Over the past 3 years, I have expanded my skill set across the innovation ecosystem through side-projects:
* Building AptaBridge, a biotech venture developing new immuno-oncology therapeutics, incorporated with co-founders in the US
* [ActivateBio 2021](https://www.activate.bio) - a 3-month pitch competition and mentorship programme with the Harvard Business School (now [Nucleate](https://nucleate.xyz))
* Due diligence for seed investment into early stage healthcare companies with the [Start Codon Accelerator](https://startcodon.co)
* [Gap Summit 2020](https://www.gapsummit.com) - an international, 10 month, virtual pitch competition and conference with the [Global Biotech Revolution](http://globalbiotechrevolution.com)
* 48h-pitch competitions at the [Cambridge Judge Business School](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/entrepreneurship/programmes/venture-creation-weekends-vcw/)
* Strategy consulting on market entry and launch of a disruptive gene therapy with IQVIA and the [Cambridge Consulting Network](https://www.cambridgeconsultingnetwork.co/cambridge/projects) Insights programme
