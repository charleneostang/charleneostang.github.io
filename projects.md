# Business projects
Over the past 2 years, I have expanded my business skill set across the innovation ecosystem.

Through challenging yet inspiring successes at Jane Street: Women in Trading & Technology and the Cambridge Judge Business School, I realised that I thrive in high-intensity environments with a continual demand to learn, adapt, and deliver. 

I have since continued to develop my skill-set through: 
* strategy consulting with IQVIA, 
* marketing and recruitment with Wiser, and 
* due diligence for seed investment into early stage healthcare companies with the Start Codon Accelerator. 

# Research projects
I have gathered over 15 months of academic research experience, from tumour immunology and virology, to bioinformatics and synthetic biology.

1. Interleukin immune signalling is necessary for mouse lung tumour regression following oncogene deactivation
  * Masters research with Professor Gerard Evan ([Dept. of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge](https://www.bioc.cam.ac.uk/research/evan); [Cancer Research UK, Cambridge](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/our-research/researchers/professor-gerard-evan))
2. The role of HPV in dysregulation of epithelial homeostasis in early cervical cancer
  * Summer research with Professor John Doorbar ([Dept. of Pathology, University of Cambridge](https://www.path.cam.ac.uk/directory/john-doorbar)) funded by Trinity College, Cambridge
3. P2Y6 receptor defiency is partially protective against synapse loss in aging mouse brains
  * Bachelors research with Professor Guy Brown ([Dept. of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge](https://www.bioc.cam.ac.uk/research/brown))
4. A bioinformatic analysis and literature review of transcriptional regulatory elements across single stranded RNA viruses
  * Wellcome Trust-funded summer research with Dr Andrew Firth ([Dept. of Pathology, University of Cambridge](https://www.path.cam.ac.uk/directory/andrew-firth))
5. Directed evolution of a self-replicating RNA enzyme to investigate the RNA world hypothesis
